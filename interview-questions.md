# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions. First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory. Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn.

1. What is object destructuring?

  Your answer: object destructuring is storing an object into a variable so that one can skip the step of specifying the object's state.
    example: {var} = this.state

  Researched answer: "The destructuring assignment syntax is a JavaScript expression that makes it possible to unpack values from arrays, or properties from objects, into distinct variables."



2. What are the three arguments that .map() can accept?

  Your answer: value, index, array

  Researched answer: "callback is invoked with three arguments: the value of the element, the index of the element, and the array object being mapped."



3. What is the difference between a class and an object?

  Your answer: Class is a blueprint for an object. Object has specific keys with assigned values whereas object only holds the keys.

  Researched answer: "A class defines object properties including a valid range of values, and a default value. A class also describes object behavior. An object is a member or an "instance" of a class. ... This subtle conceptual difference between classes and objects shows why there is a tendency to want to use them interchangeably."



4. What is the difference between a HTML div and a span?
 
  Your answer: div goes on a different line; span goes on the same line.

  Researched answer: "The difference between span and div is that a span element is in-line and usually used for a small chunk of HTML inside a line (such as inside a paragraph) whereas a div (division) element is block-line (which is basically equivalent to having a line-break before and after it) and used to group larger chunks of code."

5. What is React.Fragment and why would you want to use it?
  
  Your answer: React.Fragment (<React.Fragment></React.Fragment> or, shortened as, <></>) is a divider/tag used when using jsx (which requires to have a single wrapping tag)
  
  Researched answer: "You can use fragments to create components that return a list of elements without wrapping them in a container or array. This is useful for components that return form and text markup — as wrapping the result in a container <div> can cause headaches when styling things."

6. What are three options for creating responsive design?

  Your answer:
  - clicking?
  - scrolling?
  - hovering?

  Researched answer: 
  "Media queries. ...
Fluid grids. ...
Flexible images. ..."

(is that right?)



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week
- Object-oriented programming (OOP) refers to a type of computer programming (software design) in which programmers define the data type of a data structure, and also the types of operations (functions) that can be applied to the data structure.
- The Institutional Review Board (IRB) is an administrative body established to protect the rights and welfare of human research subjects recruited to participate in research activities conducted under the auspices of the institution with which it is affiliated.
- In object-oriented programming with classes, an instance variable is a variable defined in a class (i.e. a member variable), for which each instantiated object of the class has a separate copy, or instance. An instance variable is similar to a class variable.
- Ruby hash: A Hash is a collection of key-value pairs like this: "employee" = > "salary". It is similar to an Array, except that indexing is done via arbitrary keys of any object type, not an integer index.
- Class relationships: Three important relationships in Ruby are known as ‘belongs to…’, ‘has many…’, and “has many of each other”. The ‘belongs to’ and ‘has many’ relationships are considered to be the inverse of one another. In order to fully understand these various types of object/class relationships, they must be understood both in pseudocode and what the relationships look like programmatically.
